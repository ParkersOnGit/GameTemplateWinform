# GameTemplate
##Setup:
- Copy base code from Main.cs (namespace, class, and constructor may be differently named) or you could rename class to "Main"
- Change BackgroundImageLayout to Zoom
- Set BackColor to any color (will be the back of the color when the window is not the frameBuffer size ratio)
- Code you game!!
